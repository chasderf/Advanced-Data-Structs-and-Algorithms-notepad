2.4 MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF RECURSIVE ALGORITHMS

In this section, we will see how to apply the general framework for analysis of algorithms to recursive algorithms. 

General Plan for Analyzing Time Efficiency of Recursive Algorithms
1. Decide on a parameter (or parameters) indicating an input's size.
2. Identify the algorithm's basic operation.
3. Check whether the number of times the basic operation is executed can vary on different inputs of the same size; if it can, the worst -case, average-case, and best-case efficiencies must be investigated separately.
4. Set up a recurrence relation, with an appropriate initial condition, for the number of times the basic operation is executed.
5. Solve the recurrence or at least ascertain the order of growth of its solution.
