ALGORITHM GaussElimination(A[1..n, 1..n], b[1.n])
//Applies Gaussian elimirtation to matrix A of a system's coefficients,
//augmented with vector b of the system's right-hand side values
//Input: Matrix A[J..n, 1, .. n] and column-vector b[l..n]
//Output: An equivalent upper-triangular matrix in place of A with the
//corresponding right-hand side values in the (n + 1)st column
fori +-- 1 ton do A[i, n + 1] +-- b[i] //augments the matrix
fori +--lton-1do

LU Decomposition and Other Applications
Gaussian elimination has an interesting and very useful by-product called LU decomposition of the coefficient matrix. In fact, modern commercial implementations of Gaussian elimination are based on such a decomposition rather than on the basic algorithm outlined earlier. 



COMPUTING A DETERMINANT
Another problem that can be solved by Gaussian elimination is computing a determinant. The determinant of an n-by-n matrix A, denoted det A or I AI. is a number whose value can be defined recursively as follows. If n = 1, i.e., if A consists of a single element a11, det A is equal to a11; for n > 1, det A is computed by the recursive formula.
