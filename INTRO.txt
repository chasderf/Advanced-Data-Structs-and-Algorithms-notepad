11 LIMITATIONS OF ALGORITHM POWER

In the preceding chapters of this book, we encountered dozens of algorithms for solving a variety of different problems. A fair assessment of algorithms as problem-solving tools is inescapable: they are very powerful instruments, especially when they are executed by modern computers. But the power of algorithms is not unlimited, and its limits are the subject of this chapter. As we shall see, some problems cannot be solved by any algorithm. Other problems can be solved algorithmically but not in polynomial time. And even when a problem can be solved in polynomial time by some algorithms, there are usually lower bounds on their efficiency.
