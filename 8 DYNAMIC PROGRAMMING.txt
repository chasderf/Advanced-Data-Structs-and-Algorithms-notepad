8 DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

Dynamic programming is an algorithm design technique with a rather interesting history. It was invented by a prominent U.S. mathematician, Richard Bellman, in the 1950s as a general method for optimizing multistage decision processes. Thus, the word "programming" in the name of this technique stands for "planning" and does not refer to computer programming. After proving its worth as an important tool of applied mathematics, dynamic programming has eventually come to be considered, at least in computer science circles, as a general algorithm design technique that does not have to be limited to special types of optimization problems. It is from this point of view that we will consider this technique here. 

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems with overlapping
subproblems. Typically, these subproblems arise from a recurrence relating a solution to a given problem with solutions to its smaller subproblems of the same type. Rather than solving overlapping subproblems again and again, dynamic programming suggests solving each of the smaller subproblems only once and recording the results in a table from which we can then obtain a solution to the original problem.
