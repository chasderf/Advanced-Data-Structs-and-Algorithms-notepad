2.5 EXAMPLE: FIBONACCI NUMBERS

In this section, we consider the Fibonacci numbers, a famous sequence 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
that can be defined by the simple recurrence
		F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n>1
and two initial conditions
		F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
Explicit Formula for the nth Fibonacci Number
If we try to apply the method of backward substitutions to solve recurrence (2.6), we will fail to get an easily discernible pattern. Instead, let us take advantage of a theorem that describes solutions to a homogeneous second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients
		ax(n) + bx(n- 1) + cx(n- 2) = 0

ALGORITHMS FOR COMPUTING FIBONACCI NUMBERS
ALGORITHM F(n)
//Computes the nth Fibonacci number recursively by using its definition
//Input: A nonnegative integer n
//Output: The nth Fibonacci number
ifn::::; 1 retumn
else return F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
